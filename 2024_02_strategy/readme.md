## Motivation
Let's start with desired end state:
- Pure ETH NOs compare favorably vs competitors (eg, Lido CSM) at x bonded ETH
  - Depends on NO commission % on borrowed ETH
  - Depends on borrowed ETH per bonded ETH
- Attractive enough to rETHers to get us to y% market share
- All surplus value goes to RPL

## Core Concept
We'll start by determining a good NO commission % using the aggressive-alt bond curve I [described](../2023_11_rapid_research_incubator/bond_curves.md). The summary of that idea is that we can allow smaller ETH bonds safely by enabling MEV theft penalties across a whole node (multiple minipools); smaller ETH bonds make us dramatically more capital efficient.

Remember for context that the proposed Lido CSM ROI is 1.5 (`solo_apy * (4*0.9+32*0.075)/4 = 1.5 * solo_apy`). Here is RP capital efficiency with 3%/4%/5% of commission on borrowed ETH going to NOs:

We see that 5% commission competes favorably with Lido CSM starting at ~11 ETH bonded (2 4-ETH minipools and 2 1.5-ETH minipools). At high bonds, we do significantly better. Even 3% was able to beat out Lido CSM (starting at 30.5 ETH, aka 2 4-ETH minipools and 15 1.5 ETH minipools). That said, I explicitly would like to err on the side of growth, so I propose using 5%.

Given that Node Operation is more than competitive with the above, we can capture as much value as possible in RPL. The value captured by RPL is `rpl_pie_share*total_borrowed_eth_revenue`. I propose splitting this the simplest way - each period, an RPL staker's share is `eth_revenue_for_rpl*(their_rpl_stake/total_rpl_stake)`. In other words, we're looking for the value of `rpl_pie_share` that (a) maximizes value capture and (b) meets our [self-limiting obligations](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-17). This is nice because it means that voters (NOs with staked RPL) will likely have an incentive to make rETH attractive (to increase total_borrowed_eth and thus its revenue), even if it means they take a smaller share of the pie; this is a canonical example of a positive-sum game -- RPL voters can essentially opt to have a smaller slice of a bigger pie via vote.

### Flow diagram example
What does this look like in practice? Let's have a look at a small example.
![sankeymatic_3user.png](sankeymatic_3user.png)

Let's walk through this.

There are 3 users:
- User (a) stakes 4 ETH and 0 RPL
- User (b) stakes 8 ETH and 100 RPL
- User (c) stakes 0 ETH and 200 RPL

Now let's follow the flows:
- The best units to think about here is "Solo rewards that correspond to x ETH"
- Stage 1: we see that the NO and protocol ETH rewards are contributed
- Stage 2: the nodes have 3 validators worth of solo rewards
- Stage 3/4: rewards from the validators get split up
  - The NO claims the full solo rewards from the ETH they contributed
  - The NO gets 5% commission of the rewards from the protocol ETH
  - 9% commission of the rewards from the protocol ETH goes to _all_ Staked RPL
  - 86% of the rewards from the protocol ETH go to rETH
- Stage 5: Staked RPL rewards are split up by RPL stake

In the end:
- User (a) earns the equivalent of 5.4 ETH of solo stake (note that `5.4/4=1.35*solo`, which matches the starting point of the first plot)
- User (b) earns the equivalent of 13.32 ETH of solo stake. Here the APY vs solo stake is not as obvious -- it depends on the RPL ratio.
  - Eg, if the exchange rate is 0.02, then this user would have 10 ETH of value invested earning the equivalent of 13.32 ETH of solo stake. That would mean an ROI of `13.32/(8+.02*100) = 1.332*solo`.
  - Now consider it again with an exchange rate of 0.015. That would mean an ROI of `13.32/(8+.015*100) = 1.402*solo`.
- User (c) earns the equivalent of 5.04 ETH of solo stake. Again, RPL ratio matters.
  - With a ratio of 0.02: `5.04/(.02*200) = 1.26*solo`
  - With a ratio of 0.015: `5.04/(.015*200) = 1.68*solo`
