## Top tier
- Value capture
  - Removed 9% commission to staked RPL
  - Added 1% commission to voters
  - Added 8% commission to RPL buy+burn

## Tier 2
- Dynamics: discussed a way to mitigate the conflict of interest from voters voting on voting slice 
- Added "RPL buy+burn thoughts" section with candidate design
- Added "Voter share thoughts" section
- Added a new "Stepping stone" possibility - remove RPL requirement in the interim

## Tier 3
- Remove "Voting power" top bullet in "Suggested support". This is now being incentivized much more directly.
- Remove "Staked RPL... or all RPL?" section. Because the voting power concern was addressed, we were able to go with "all RPL"
- Add support for the settings that start at 0 (oDAO commision, pDAO commision, RPL rewards spec)
- Remove vague "there should be a way to exit NO queue bullet"
- Add "Other consideration bullet" for ETH credit cash out
- Add "Other consideration bullet" for initial stake flow
