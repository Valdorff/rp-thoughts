# 2023-11 Budget Update (RPIP-10)

This vote aims to correct a budget implementation error and further increase the IMC budget.

### Outcomes if vote passes
- The mismatch between intent and implementation in an [earlier vote](https://vote.rocketpool.net/#/proposal/0x510383ca82a0096fa670a260692cf7a4097e199ce4f731dc4efd97a21f19f988) will be corrected
  - Forward-looking, the split will be corrected to match intent for both IMC and GMC
  - Backward-looking, a one-time payment will be made to the IMC from the pDAO treasury to make up for the periods since the mismatch
- The IMC's split of the pDAO's incoming funds will be increased by 16%

### Rationale
The earlier vote had a math error in the implementation (as noted on the [forum](https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/intended-vs-actual-budget-mismatch-in-rpip-10/2053?u=valdorff)). This vote is to resolve the error both moving forward and retroactively via a one-time transfer.

In addition, this vote increases the IMC's portion of the inflation split by 16%, which is roughly "50% of funds that were initially going to the oDAO that now go to the pDAO". This value was arrived at mostly from a [forum poll](https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/justification-for-moving-odao-inflation-to-the-imc/1939/12), but taking a conservative step as a starting point.
