# RPL Staking Rework (RPIP-30)

This vote aims to align RPL reward spend with rETH capacity created.

### Summary
- RPL rewards will scale differently, with a focus on aligning RPL rewards with supplying rETH
- It will be possible to withdraw down to 15% borrowed ETH (this threshold is currently 150% of bonded ETH)
- We will transition to the new states over time (some implementation time, six reward periods of ramping, and fully implementing the withdrawal changes will need a smart contract release)
- Withdrawing will become a 2-step process where RPL is set to "withdrawing" for 28 days before it can be withdrawn

### Rationale
The goal is to align the DAO's spending on RPL rewards with the DAO's goals. In particular, we'll continue to send 70% of inflation to Node Operators, but better align it far more with the amount of minted rETH.

_Please_ read the Intro document's [context section](https://github.com/Valdorff/rp-thoughts/tree/main/rpl_staking#context) for a visual representation of spending before and after this change. 

### Outcomes if vote passes
- RPL rewards will scale differently
  - Adding a minipool will increase RPL rewards (even if you already had enough staked RPL)
  - Converting an EB16 to two LEB8s will increase rewards (even if you already had enough staked RPL)
  - You will still need staked RPL value of â‰¥10% borrowed ETH to get RPL rewards [unchanged]
  - Staking more RPL will mean more rewards [unchanged], though now without a maximum (note that marginal APR gets lower and lower as more is staked)
  - Beyond 15% borrowed ETH, additional rewards go up slower and slower
  - The rewards changes will be phased in slowly over 6 months
- It will be possible to withdraw down to 15% borrowed ETH
- RPL withdrawal will become a 2-step process
  - Set X RPL to "withdrawing"; these RPL are no longer eligible for rewards or voting 
  - After 28 days, the RPL may be withdrawn
  - The new rules will be partially phased in over time, and then fully implemented with the next smart contract release
  - Note that this will apply to all withdrawals, even ones that would currently be instant
  - Note that this will not apply to claiming rewards, as that isn't a withdrawal
- Once the 2-step process is implemented, the current "28-day withdrawal lock when you stake RPL" will be removed 
- These changes will apply equally to both existing and new NOs
